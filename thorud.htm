        <div class="letter"><p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
            <p>This is a letter of recommendation for Scott Klein</p>
            <p>My name is Bruce Thorud and I am the General Manager of Boscov&#39s Department Store
            in the Berkshire Mall in Reading Pa. I have over 35 years of experience in the retail community
            having held positions as Senior Vice President, Vice President and General Manager. I provide my
            background as a source to indicate that I have had vast experience in dealing with people at all levels
            and have had the experience of assessing their character and integrity.</p>
            <p>Scott Klein has been in Boscov&#39s employ for over 10 years, which has given me the opportunity to
            formulate opinions about him both personally and professionally. I feel I have come to know Scott quite well
            and would like to provide you with the following information.</p>
            <p>I first me Scott while he was participating in an orientation and training session for new associates
            when opening the Berkshire Mall store, where he stood out as a leader in the group. Scott was instrumental in
            uplifting spirits and encouraging the associates in his class through what can be a difficult and tedious process.
            Upon completing his assignments he would help others and emerged as a very positive force among his peer group.</p>
            <p>Scott is an exceptional Manager who I am proud to have on my team. He has continually demonstrated by his conduct
            that he is willing to take on any responsibility large or small with out hesitation. He works very hard and is willing to
            go the extra distance to insure the quality of the assignment. Scott has always performed at a very high level,
            and therefore is a vital and critical associate of the store. Many times, I have asked Scott to work additional
            hours beyond his normal schedule and he has done so willingly. The example he has set for his fellow associates and
            managers is one that establishes the tone for exceeding expectations at all levels. Scott is an individual with the
            tenacity to accomplish the objective, perseverance to never give up, and drive to make it happen.</p>
            <p>On numerous occasions, I have sought Scott&#39s council on solving problems for not only his areas of responsibility,
            but for the entire store. Scott has the ability to anticipate potential issues looking at them from a global point of view and
            resolve them for the betterment of the store. Scott&#39s intellect has proven to be an asset to Boscov&#39s and has
            garnered the respect of our management team. Anticipating and solving problems are one of his greatest strengths,
            and he has earned my utmost admiration.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, I would like to give Scott my highest endorsement. He is bright, articulate, a natural leader
            and has the ability to motivate and inspire his fellow team members. It is my pleasure to give Scott this recommendation.</p>
            <p>I am also available to answer any questions that you may have and would encourage you to contact me. I can be reached
            at 610-779-2000 Berkshire Mall ext. 1211 or at <a href="mailto:bthorud@boscovs.com?subject=In%20regards%20to%20Scott%20Klein&amp;body=Dear Mr. Thorud," title="Send email to Bruce Thorud">bthorud@boscovs.com</a>.
