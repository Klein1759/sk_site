            <p>LAUNCELOT:  I know not, my liege.</p>
            <p>ARTHUR:  Consult the Book of Armaments!</p>
            <p>BROTHER MAYNARD:  Armaments, Chapter Two, verses Nine to Twenty-one.</p>
            <p>SECOND BROTHER:  And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,
                &#39O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow thine
                enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.&#39  And the Lord did grin, and the people
                did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans
                and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu--</p>
            <p>MAYNARD:  Skip a bit, Brother.</p>
            <p>SECOND BROTHER:  And the Lord spake, saying, &#39First shalt thou take out the
                Holy Pin.  Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.  Three shalt
                be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be
                three.  Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting
                that thou then proceed to three.  Five is right out.  Once the number
                three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand
                Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall
                snuff it.&#39</p><br> -->

                I created this sign entirely by hand coding. There was no one behind the curtain operating the controls
                except for me. I used <a href="http://www.webuilderapp.com" target=_blank>WeBuilder 2014</a> to hand code this.
                However I do also have <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org" target=_blank>Notepad++</a> and have dabbled with it, but
                right now I&#39m leaning towards <a href="http://www.webuilderapp.com" target=_blank>WeBuilder 2014</a>. If you have
                any other suggestion on what else I could use let me know in an <a href="mailto:scott.klein13@gmail.com?subject=In regards%20to%20your%20Scott%20Klein%20Info%20site&amp;body=Scott,%0D%0A%0D%0AYou might want to try ... because" title="Send suggestions to Scott" class="email">email</a>.
            <p>This site is also going to be changing and expanding. Although I have not decided which it will be yet,
            it will probably be both.</p>
            Current list of things to do in no particular order except for top-down:
            <ul>
                <li>Create mobile version of this site using CSS</li>
                <li>Adding META keywords/phrases for SEO puposes</li>
                <li>Finish commenting my code so you can enjoy viewing the source</li>
                <li><strike>Finish the <a href="default.htm" title="Back to find the Rabbit Hole">Rabbit Hole</a></strike></li>
                <li>Fix issues I don&#39t know about</li>
                <li>Other things I haven&#39t thought of yet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please enjoy your stay and <span class="italics">explore</span>. But I cannot guarantee your safety once you have gone down the <a href="default.htm" title="Back to find the Rabbit Hole">Rabbit Hole</a>.</p>
