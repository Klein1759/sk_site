            <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
            <p>I would like to express my interest in obtaining a job in the Information Technology field. This website that I created is my resume, cover letter, application and calling card.
            I hope you enjoy it and explore all of the options available. I have an array of qualities that will definitely be a strong contribution to any position available. My experience
            and education along with the drive to succeed would make me an asset to your staff. </p>
            <p>In my years of being an Area Manager at the Berkshire location of the Boscov’s Department Store, I have learned to handle many unexpected situations with customers and work situations.
            Working in a department of new and changing technology means that I have to keep myself educated with emerging technology. I have traveled to several different states implementing store openings,
            educating new employees on product information and helping to provide solutions for various issues within the company and at my store location as they arise.</p>
            <p>Challenging work put before me is where I best excel. I take pride in the quality of my workmanship and the ability to handle adversity with ease. I have come across many situations which have
            required quick thinking with the handling of cumbersome issues and problems. Being a quick study of new information and technology has been extremely beneficial for me. I have exceeded several goals
            at Boscov’s, one of these being one of the top rated sales people in the company on every level. My department has received recognition and awards for its outstanding performance which reflects my leadership and guidance.</p>
            <p>I have attained a Bachelor of Science from Albright College in Information Technology in December 2012. This accomplishment is one of several that I am proud of completing considering it was done
            while working forty or more hours a week while managing a 3.6 GPA. And when I attended Albright College I was told that I would be graduating with all the skills I needed to obtain a job in the computer programming field.
            A while later I came to realize this simply was not true. I did a little research and started to teach myself more languages while reviewing the ones I was already taught.</p>
            <p>I discovered several web sites that I have found helpful in my pursuit of reviewing my current languages and also helping me to learn new skills. These sites include; w3schools.com, codeacademy.com,
            and treehouse.com. Using these sites I have reviewed HTML/CSS, SQL and Java. But also using these sites I have taught myself JavaScript/jQuery. To complement my online learning I have purchased books
            to reference as I continue to expand my skills and put them to use.</p>
            <p>Over the years I have enjoyed being hands on with computer components. I have built at least five computers and maintained several others. To keep these computers operating, I've had to diagnose their software and hardware issue then proceed with the corrective action.</p>
            <p>I would like the opportunity to meet with you to further discuss my qualifications and how I would be an asset to your company. Please feel free to contact me at my home phone number of (610)987-6703 to schedule an interview.</p>
            <br>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br><br>
            Sincerely,<br><br><br>
            Scott Klein
