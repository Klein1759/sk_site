            <p>Dear Hiring Manager:</p>
            <p>I was initially impressed with Scott Klein&#39s enthusiasm and professional demeanor when he first helped
            me set up a new store location for Boscov&#39s Department Stores in 1998. During the following 14 years I watched
            Scott develop from a top producing salesperson into an elite department manager.</p>
            <p>Scott is reliable, honest and works well with both his supervisors and his staff. His ability to get the job
            done with little to no supervision is a testament to his outstanding work ethic. Scott can multitask and can
            handle a high volume work load. He has a team play mind set and an ethusiastic attitude towards any new challenge.</p>
            <p>Most of the department managers that worked for me over my 28 year career at Boscov&#39s had the ability to identify a problem.
            What set Scott apart from the norm was the fact did he not only identify the problem, he would find the source and solve it.
            He has my highest recommendation and I am happy to furnish more detail if you would like additional information.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p><br><br>
            Frank Malfet<br><br>
